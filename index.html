      <h1>Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening — <i>Robert Frost</i></h1>

      <p>
        Whose woods these are I think I know.<br>
        His house is in the village though;<br>
        He will not see me stopping here<br>
        To watch his woods fill up with snow.
      </p>

      <p>
        My little horse must think it queer<br>
        To stop without a farmhouse near<br>
        Between the woods and frozen lake<br>
        The darkest evening of the year.
      </p>

      <p>
        He gives his harness bells a shake<br>
        To ask if there is some mistake.<br>
        The only other sound’s the sweep<br>
        Of easy wind and downy flake.
      </p>

      <p>
        The woods are lovely, dark and deep,<br>
        But I have promises to keep,<br>
        And miles to go before I sleep,<br>
        And miles to go before I sleep.
